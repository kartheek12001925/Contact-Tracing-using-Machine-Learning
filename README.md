# Contact-Tracing-using-Machine-Learning

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores the use of chest X-ray images to detect potential contact links between patients by analyzing visual similarities in their lungs. The core idea is to build a graph-based network where patients are connected if their X-ray images show high similarity â€” helping visualize possible contact chains and aiding in early tracing efforts.

Dataset
Source: (http://kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

Classes:
1)Normal
2)COVID
3)Lung Opacity
4)Viral Pneumonia

Structure: Images are organized into folders by class. Each folder contains a large number of chest X-ray images.

ðŸ§ª Project Workflow
Data Collection & Organization
Images are loaded from class-specific folders stored in Google Drive.

Image Preprocessing
All images are resized to a standard size for fair comparison. Basic exploratory analysis is done to understand image brightness, contrast, and structure.

Image Similarity Detection
Image similarity is calculated using visual histograms. If the similarity exceeds a defined threshold, the images are considered "linked."

Graph Construction
Each image is treated as a node. Edges are drawn between nodes (patients) if their images are similar enough. This forms a graph that highlights potential contact links.

Visualization
The contact tracing graph is plotted, where clusters or connected components may indicate related transmission or exposure.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Demonstrate how medical imaging can assist in epidemiological tracing.

Provide a visual tool to map potential exposure paths.

Build a reusable framework for image-based contact tracing.

ðŸ“Š Insights & Outcomes
Patterns in lung opacity and structure can be compared visually to find image-level similarities.

Patients with similar lung X-ray features often cluster in the graph, suggesting potential exposure linkage.

Graph theory provides a compelling way to model and visualize contact networks from visual data.

ðŸ§° Tools Used
Google Colab + Google Drive

Python

Pandas, NumPy

PIL & OpenCV (for image processing)

NetworkX (for graph construction)

Matplotlib & Plotly (for visualization)

ðŸš€ Potential Improvements
Use structural similarity index (SSIM) or deep learning embeddings for better accuracy.

Incorporate metadata like patient ID, time of test, and symptoms.

Enable interactive dashboards for public health use.
